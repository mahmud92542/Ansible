Ansible

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. 
It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. 
It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration.

Ansible is an agentless service. It requireds simple ssh connectivity. 

Inventory File (path /etc/ansible/hosts) ini format

#sample Inventory File

server1.company.com
server2.company.com

[mail]
server3.company.com
server4.company.com

[db]
server5.company.com
server6.company.com

[web]
server7.company.com
server8.company.com

[all_server:children]
mail
db
web

#more sample inventory file

web	ansible_host=server1.company.com	ansible_connection=ssh		ansible_user=root
db 	ansible_host=server2.company.com	ansible_connection=ssh		ansible_user=admin
mail	ansible_host=server3.company.com	ansible_connection=winrm	ansible_ssh_pass=64af648fdf5
web2	ansible_host=server4.company.com	ansible_connection=ssh		ansible_user=root

localhost ansible_connection=localhost

#inventoryu peremeter
 1. ansible_connection - ssh/winrm for windows/localhost
 2. ansible_port - 22/5986
 3. ansible_user - root/administrator
 4. ansible_ssh_pass - Password

This isn't very good practices.
