Two ways of running Ansible

Ansible & Ansible-Playbook

Ansible

ansible <hosts> -a <command>
ansible all -a "/sbin/reboot"
ansible <hosts> -m <module>
ansible target1 -m ping

##seperate command on each line## 
this is not very ideal
example:
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.txt



Ansible-Playbook

ansible-playbook <playbook name>

example:
ansible-playbook playbook-pingtest.yaml -i inventory.txt

inventory file must be specefied by both in ansible and ansible-playbook with (-i)
