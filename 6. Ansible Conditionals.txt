when a service depends on others there comes conditions

#sample ansible file

-
    name: Start service
    hosts: all_servers
    tasks:
	-    service: 
			name=mysql
			state=started
	     when: ansible_host == "db.company.com"

	-    service:
			name:httpd
			state=started
	     when: ansible_connection == "web1.company.com" or
		   ansible_connection == "web2.company.com"

you can use "or","and" for comparison
